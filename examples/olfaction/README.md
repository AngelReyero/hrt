# Example of HRTs applied to data from an olfactory response prediction experiment

This is a case study applied to the predictive modeling approach in the following paper:

Keller, A., Gerkin, R. C., Guan, Y., Dhurandhar, A., Turu, G., Szalai, B., ... & Vens, C. (2017). Predicting human olfactory perception from chemical features of odor molecules. Science.

## Running

The code in `main.py` generates p-values for the top 10 features chosen by the scikit-learn random forest feature importance heurstic.

To run this code, you will need to download three data files:
